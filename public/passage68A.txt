***PASSAGE 1***
<p>Always in those first few minutes when the shuttle left the parent ship and accelerated to clear the gravita­tional pull of the larger mass,  Lee was sure she had made a terrible mistake.  She didn’t belong  here; none of them did—fragile creatures set in rows in a canister shot through black space. She belonged to Earth. To be here was madness,  an  insane presumption,  and  there was no way to escape. </p>
<p>All   she   was,   all   she   had   accomplished, meant   nothing  in  this  time  of  desperate  sanity.  The  fifty-odd men and women in the cabin with her were all accom­ plished, all experts in their fields, and all incidental. </p>

<p>
    <span class="Q2">
    As  the  shuttle  turned,  the  cameras  gave  them  a view of the Kekule, the parent ship receding in the distance. Three miles long, half a mile deep and wide, the starship was a tribute to the art of welding. It floated in deep  space like a chunk  of bizarre litter.  The word “starship” evoked a far more poetic image than the real thing, Lee thought as she watched. 
    </span>
</p>

<p>
    Around  her,  people talked  and  laughed.  She didn’t join in, nor did they try to talk to her. Past experience had  taught them she was best left alone in  shuttles— unless they wanted to be snapped at. <span class="Q6">In the confinement of starships individual quirks became well-known. </span>
    
</p>

<p>
    The planet Xilan  appeared  on  the screen,  as green as Earth  was blue.  From this distance it suggested  an agate ball,  variegated  with  white,  shining  and untouched.  It had  been  discovered  five hundred  Earth years before; there were records of several landings there,  but little more than  basic data survived  in  the corporate archives.  At the time of its discovery  Xilan had  been  considered  too  far from Earth  to  make colo­ nization  profitable,  too  far to  plunder for mineral wealth. Technology was changing that. 
    
</p>

<p>
    Hours passed.  Polar ice caps and  land  masses came into focus. The white became clouds and then the gleam of snow-capped  mountains.  A wide tapering  of beige suggested that desert covered the center of one continent. Rivers veined into view. Several volcanoes plumed into the upper atmosphere. 
</p>

<p>

    <span class="Q3">
        For Leland Hamlin, biologist, all this had just one joyous message—a wide variety of life forms existed on this world, animals never seen before, each one unique and fascinating. The archives reported only lower life forms here, but to her that proved nothing. Five hundred years earlier, tests of sentience had been <span class="Q8">crude</span>, full of Earthly chauvinism, unreliable.    
    </span>
</p>

<p>
    Born in a ring-world colony in L5, she had grown up  without  ever  seeing  any  animals  but  humans—and  she missed animals. Her father said she was a product of a more primitive era.  The data banks of her first learning  center had  been  almost exclusively  devoted  to zoology.  At fourteen,  she had  qualified  for a scholar­ ship at an Earthside university. 
    
</p>

<p>
    She had  gone to  her home planet expecting  to  find the wealth of species detailed in her studies. She found instead  that humans had  permitted  only  those creatures which served them to survive. The rest were extinct and had  been  for generations past.  The child  in  her never quite forgave her ancestors for that crime. 
    
</p>
<p>
    The ancient zoologist Beebe had written, <span class="Q4">"... when the last individual of a race of living things breathes no more, another heaven and another earth must pass before such a one can come again.”</span> And so, finding Earth desolate, she searched. 
    
</p>
<p>
    It was not a quest one could go on alone, although she would have liked to. But she had learned the practi­ cal must enter into the realization of any dream, so when an employment recruiter from one of Earth’s largest corporations offered her a job as a biochemist on a deep space exploration venture, she accepted. 
    
</p>
<p>
    Fifteen space years had passed since then, and five more expeditions. Study during travel time had earned her two more doctorates. Two of her trip logs had been  so well written, so alive with her enthusiasm, that they sold throughout Earth’s federation as popular adventure books. She had gained also in that time a devout respect for life. It was so rare a phenomenon. Entire galaxies existed without a trace of <span class="Q10">it</span>. Billions of years passed on planets while nothing ever changed but rock. 
</p>

<p>
    On Xilan’s night side, in the lowest and last orbit, she saw a dull red glow of surface fire and something glinting in its light—lightning-struck vegetation, or molten lava? The shuttle was too close to the surface and moving too fast for its cameras to see clearly. She glanced at nearby colleagues; none seemed to have noticed anything remarkable. The belltone signaled that they were landing.

SOCIAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the article “The Social Life of Paper” by Malcolm Gladwell (©2002 by The Conde Nast Publications).
***PASSAGE 2***
<p>
    Computer technology  was supposed  to  replace paper.  But that hasn’t happened.  Every  country  in  the Western  world  uses more paper today,  on  a per-capita basis,  than  it did  ten  years ago.  The consumption  of uncoated  free-sheet paper,  for instance—the most common  kind  of office paper—rose almost fifteen  per cent in the United States between 1995 and 2000. This is generally  taken  as evidence of how hard  it is to eradicate old,  wasteful habits and  of how stubbornly resistant we are to the efficiencies offered by computer­ ization.  A number of cognitive psychologists and ergonomic’experts,  however,  don’t agree.  Paper has persisted,  they  argue,  for very  good  reasons: when  it comes to  performing  certain  kinds of cognitive tasks, paper has many advantages over computers.
</p>

<p>
    The case for paper is made most eloquently in The Myth  of the Paperless Office, by  two  social scientists, Abigail Sellen  and  Richard  Harper.  They  begin  their book with an account of a study they conducted at the International Monetary  Fund,  in  Washington,  D.C. Economists at the IMF spend most of their time writing reports on  complicated  economic questions,  work  that would seem to be perfectly suited to sitting in front of a computer. Nonetheless, the IMF is <span class="Q19">awash</span> in paper, and Sellen and Harper wanted to find out why. Their answer is that the business of writing  reports—at least at the IMF—is an  intensely  collaborative process,  involving the professional judgments and  contributions of many people.  <span class="Q18">The economists bring  drafts of reports to  conference rooms, spread out the relevant pages, and nego­ tiate changes with  one another.  They  go  back  to  their offices and  jot down  comments in  the margin,  taking advantage of the freedom offered by the informality of the handwritten  note.  Then  they  deliver the annotated draft to the author in person, taking him or her, page by page, through the suggested changes. At the end of the process, the author spreads out all the pages with com­ ments on a desk and starts to enter them on the com­ puter—moving  the pages around,  organizing  and reorganizing, saving and discarding. </span>
    
</p>

<p>
    Without paper,  this kind  of collaborative,  iterative work process would be much more difficult. According to Sellen and Harper, paper has a unique set of “affor­ dances”—that-is,  qualities that permit specific kinds of uses. Paper is tangible: we can pick up a document, flip through  it,  read  little bits here and  there,  and  quickly get a sense of it.  Paper is spatially  flexible,  meaning that we can spread it out and arrange it in the way that suits us best. And it’s tailorable: we can easily annotate it,  and  scribble on  it as we read,  without altering  the original text.  Digital documents,  of course,  have their own  affordances.  They  can  be easily  searched,  shared, stored,  accessed  remotely,  and  linked  to  other relevant material.  But they  lack  the affordances that really matter  to  a  group  of  people  working  together  on  a report.
    
</p>

<p>
    Paper enables a certain  kind  of thinking.  What covers many desks are piles of paper—-journals, maga­ zines,  binders,  postcards,  videotapes,  and  all the other artifacts of the knowledge economy. When a group at a leading computer company studied piling behavior sev­ eral years ago, they found that even the most disorderly piles usually make perfect sense to the piler. Over time, piles get broken down and resorted, sometimes chronologically  and’ thematically; clues about certain  docu­ ments may be physically embedded in the file by, say, stacking a certain piece of paper at an angle or inserting dividers into the stack. 
    
</p>
<p>
    But  why  do  we  pile  documents  instead  of  filing  them?  Because  piles  represent  the  process  of  active, ongoing thinking. The psychologist Alison Kidd, whose research  Sellen  and  Harper refer to  extensively,  argues that “knowledge workers” use the physical space of the desktop to hold “ideas which they cannot yet categorize or even decide how they might use.” The messy desk is not necessarily  a sign  of disorganization.  It may  be a sign  of complexity: those who  deal with  many  unre­ solved  ideas simultaneously  cannot sort and  file the papers on  their desks,  because they  haven’t yet sorted and filed the ideas in their head. Kidd writes that many of the people she talked to use the papers on their desks as contextual cues to “recover a complex set of threads without difficulty  and  delay” when  they  come in  on  a Monday morning, or after their work has been interrupted by a phone call. What we see when we look at the piles on our desks is, in a sense, the contents of our brains.

<p>
    <span class="Q23"><span class="Q21">Years ago a girl, handed me a note as I was leaving her proud  town  of Albany,  Texas,  a tiny,  lovely  place far in the west of our big state.</span> “I’m glad to know there is another poemist in  the world,” the note said.  “I always knew we would  find  one another someday and our lights would cross.”</span>
</p>

<p>
    Our lights would cross. That girl had not stood out to me, I realized, among the other upturned, interested faces in the classroom. <span class="Q21">How many other lights had I missed?</span> I carried her smudged note for thousands of miles. 
    
</p>

<p>
    I was fascinated with the earliest poems I read and heard  that gave insight into  all the secret territories of the human  spirit,  our relationships with  one another. Somehow those glimpses felt comforting,  like looking through  the lit windows of other people’s homes at dusk,  before they  closed  the curtains.  How did  other people live their lives? <span class="Q24">Just a <em>sense</em> of so many other worlds out there, beginning with the next house on my own street, gave me a great energy. How could anyone ever feel lonely?</span> <span class="Q21">One of the first books I loved in my life was a thick, gray anthology edited by Helen Ferris, called  Favorite Poems Old  and  New.</span> Rich,  intelligent voices spoke to  me each  time I opened  its covers.'  I found  Rabindranath  Tagore,  Carl Sandburg,  Emily Dickinson, living side by side. I imagined I was part of a much larger family. 
    
</p>

<p>
    To me the world of poetry is a house with thou­ sands of glittering windows. <span class="Q21">Our words and images, land to land, era to era, shed light on one another.</span> Our words dissolve the <span class="Q25">shadows</span> we imagine fall between. <span class="Q23">“One night I dreamt of spring,” writes Syrian poet Muhammad al Maghut, “and when I awoke I flowers covered my pillow.”</span> Isn’t this where empathy begins? Other countries stop seeming quite so “foreign,” or inanimate, or strange, when we listen to the intimate voices of their citizens. <span class="Q23">I can never understand it when teachers claim they are “uncomfortable” with poetry— as if poetry demands they be anything other than responsive, curious human beings.</span> If poetry comes out of the deepest places in the human soul and experience, shouldn’t it be as important to learn about one another’s poetry, country to country, as one another’s weather or gross national products? It seems critical to me.
    
</p>

<p>
    It’s another way to study geography! Anyone who feels poetry is an alien or ominous form should consider the style in which human beings think. “How do you think?” I ask my students. “Do you think in complete, elaborate sentences? In fully developed paragraphs with careful footnotes? Or in flashes and bursts of images, snatches of lines leaping one to the next, descriptive fragments, sensory details?” We think in poetry. But some people pretend poetry is <span class="Q26">far away</span>. 
    
</p>
<p>
    Probably  some of us were taught so  long  and  hard that poetry was a thing to analyze that we lost our abil­ity to find it delicious, to ppreciate its taste, sometimes even when we couldn’t completely apprehend its mean­ing. <span class="Q23">I love to offer students a poem now and then that I don’t really understand. It presents them with the immediate opportunity of being smarter than I am. Believe me, they always take it.</span>They always find an interesting way to look through its window. 
    
</p>
<p>
    I’m reminded of a dear teacher I had in high school who  refused  to  go  on  to  the next poem in  our antiquated textbook until we had all agreed on the same interpretive vision of each poem—her vision. If we can offer each  other a cognizance of mystery through  the poems we share, isn’t that a greater gift? Won’t a sense of inevitable mystery underpinning our intricate lives serve us better than the notion that we will each be given a neat set of blanks to fill in—always? 
    
</p>
<p>
    Poems respect our ability to interpret and translate images and signs. Poems link seemingly disparate parts of experience—this seems particularly  critical today.  I have yet to  meet one person  in  all my  travels who doesn’t say they are too busy, they wish they had a little more time. <span class="Q28">If most of us have lost, as some poets sug­gest, our meaningful, deep relationships with the world  of  nature,  poems  help  us,  to  see  and  feel  that  world again,  beyond  our  cities  and  double-locked  doors.</span>  I have learned as much about nature from the poems of Mary Oliver as I have ever learned walking in the woods. 
    
</p>
<p>
    And  since we now live in  a world  where activities in  one person’s woods have a direct relationship  on countries far away—the disappearing  rain  forests in southern Mexico and Hawaii and the changing weather everywhere, for example—we need to know one another. It is an imperative, not a luxury.

    NATURAL SCIENCE: This passage is adapted from the book Life's Matrix: A Biography of Water by Philip Ball (©1999 by Philip Ball).    
</p>
***PASSAGE 4***

<p>
    Every  day,  every  passing  second,  water is on  the move.  The rivers flow,  the oceans perform their slow and  elegant gyrations,  the clouds congeal and  weep. Each  3,100  years,  a volume of water equivalent to  all the oceans passes through the atmosphere, carried there by  evaporation  and  removed  by  precipitation.  Yet only a thousandth  of 1  percent of the planet’s total water resides in  the atmosphere at any  moment,  enough  to deposit just one inch  of rain  if it all fell <span class="Q37">uniformly</span> throughout the world.  This constant overturn  of water between  the reservoirs on  land,  in  sea,  and  in  sky  is called the hydrological cycle, and it is as crucial for life on Earth as is the presence of liquid water in the first place.
    
</p>
<p>
    Most of the water that falls as rain has found its way into the sky from the sea surface: the Sun’s heat removes from the oceans the equivalent of three feet in depth each year—208 cubic miles in total every day. A further 38 cubic miles evaporates each day from the land surface. Of course, this rate of evaporation varies widely with the seasons and with geographical location: because the tropics are warmer, the rate of evaporation there is at least four times greater than at the poles. 
    
</p>
<p>
    Evaporation from the ground and from plants (a process called transpiration) removes water to the atmosphere, while precipitation, generally as rain and snow, supplies it to the land. The difference between precipitation and evaporation defines the amount of fresh water available for lakes, streams, and other reserves on land. This “runoff,” which is mostly returned to the oceans through rivers, adds up to about 24 cubic miles globally per day. 
    
</p>
<p>
    The various cogs of the hydrological cycle turn at a  wide  range  of  speeds.  Rainfall  in  a  river’s  upland source region  can  take weeks to  reach  the sea,  while water vapor evaporated  from the sea surface typically takes about ten  days to  fall again  as rain.  For water locked up as ice (in the so-called cryosphere), the cogs may grind slowly indeed. The water at the base of the polar ice sheets has typically been frozen for hundreds of thousands of years. Most mountain glaciers melt and recede by several miles every decade under present-day conditions,  while the sea ice in the polar seas expands and retreats seasonally. 
    
</p>
<p>
    The very existence of a hydrological cycle is a consequence of water’s unique ability to exist in more than one physical state—solid, liquid, or gas—under the conditions that prevail at the surface of the planet. Volcanic areas excepted, the Earth’s surface never gets  hot enough to boil water; but it evaporates readily nonetheless, since the amount of water vapor in the air is generally well below the “saturation vapor pressure,” which indicates the maximum humidity of air before water droplets start to condense. That s why the oceans are, to a greater or lesser degree, always “steaming.” When moist air cools, the water vapor may condense back to the liquid state, producing the pearly billows of clouds or the dank blankets of mountain mist. 
    
</p>
<p>
    The freezing of water, meanwhile, can send it on a  millennia-long  detour  from  the  cycle  of  evaporation and  precipitation.  Yet the ability  of water to  enter the solid state is also a crucial aspect of the overall cycle. When  water is frozen  during  the ice ages,  the world’s seas recede, the climate becomes drier, deserts expand, and ecosystems may be utterly transformed. 
    
</p>
<p>
    The hydrological cycle emphasizes the dynamic nature of the Earth’s environment: it is constantly repeating  and  renewing  itself.  Substances other than water are cycled by geological and biological processes too. These cyclic sequences of chemical and biological transformation of the elements are called biogeochemi­ cal cycles. 
    
</p>
<p>
    <span class="Q35">Water is the lubricant for biogeochemical cycling. Because  it  is  such  a  superb  solvent,  and  because  it  is  itself in  constant flux,  it helps to  convey  other sub­ stances hither and thither, between different ecosystems and  different climates.  Carbon  dioxide in  the atmo­ sphere dissolves in the surface waters of the sea to pro­ vide a carbon source for marine photosynthesis, and in turn  this biological growth  in  the ocean’s upper layer drives the rest of the ocean’s carbon  cycle.  Essential nutrients pervade the seas in  soluble form: nitrate, phosphate,  sulfate,  and  metals such  as iron.  The swift churning  of the hydrological cycle helps to  drive the cycling of these other substances: rain and rivers flush inorganic nutrients out of the minerals of the rocky Earth and carry them to the sea. There is little exagger­ ation in saying that it is water, in the end, that makes the world go round. </span>
